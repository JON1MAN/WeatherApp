# WeatherApp

I'm learning Java. One day I asked my friend, who is working as lead backend dev, 
how to make my learning to code more efficient, and he told me to make Projects.
I tried to make mu own  projects, but always faced a ploblem with composition of my code.
And i found some videos on YouTube how another developers build their projects.

This Project IS NOT MINE. 

I found video on YouTube how to build Weather Application and how to make API calls.
I learnt a lot from this video and figure out how to build projects.
